                            <p> I've been trying to find a solution to this maddening thing Pro Tools is doing, and would like to hear what this forum has to offer. Pro Tools has been randomly selecting audio clip files in my projects to store in a folder outside the project folder, on my root directory, a folder it creates for itself, named "Pro Tools Projects". I stumbled upon this folder a couple of weeks ago and, because I had been relocating a bunch of PT files, assumed it to be stray files and deleted Get Outlook Email File folder migration to PDF Tool that can easily export Outlook MSG file folder to PDF with attachments. It supports batch approach for quick migration process. (http://migration-issues-elimination.blogspot.com/2019/03/outlook-email-file-folder-msg-to-pdf.html). Last weekend I posted a tool for the aforementioned (for macOS/Windows and Linux) and got some good suggestions/improvements to be made. Changes made include: Complete UI redesign Improved queue efficiency Can minimize to tray on Windows (+ status notifications -Mac/Linux coming soon) More information on scan/conversion status. Error file log Queue load status window No issues with Windows source files containing special characters https://imgur.com/a/otJb3Js (https://imgur.com/a/otJb3. QUESTION: What solution would you recommend for encrypting files/folders, if your wanted to be as certain as possible to not run into problems when decrypting them in the future -- let's say 10-15 years from today? BACKGROUND: I have some (folders containing) private and confidential files. For example: very private photos and tens of thousands of old emails that I have downloaded and removed from my previous Hotmail and Gmail accounts. These files are currently. 
Windows 10 Start Menu - Most of the time, doesn't even show the correct results. Nice new and improved Start Menu, Microsoft. File Server search - Continuously stops functioning even though I've rebuilt the index countless times. Only fixed on reboot. Exchange Admin Console (O365) - Went to go add "Read and Manage" rights to a termed employee box, search function couldn't locate the user. Had to select the user from the "list of all users" I'm not sure what happened or when it happened This is what I mean: https://i.imgur.com/rZqpZgy.png (https://i.imgur.com/rZqpZgy.png) What do those numbers. I use Google Drive. I was using File Stream. I had issues. I moved on to Mountain Duck. Mountain Duck just works like you are moving files between folders. That is fine. I am not looking for true synch functionality anyways. I just want Gdrive to mount as a drive and folder functionality. Anyways. I am moving some large backup files - I have some bigger then 250 gb. They are taking 30+ hours to move. Once again, I am absolutely fine with that. BUT. if something happens Hi everyone, I'm Mike, Community Manager at NexusMods.com (https://NexusMods.com) Following the conversation here (https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/bgo8f3/star_citizen_35_steam_controller_profile/), u/8bitcerberus and I have been discussing how we can make Nexus Mods a home for you guys to share your config settings/profiles. The idea we have currently is that I can set up a global tag called something like "Steam Controller Input. 
I was mucking around in a scene, wanted to delete an object from that scene, and apparently I didn't click hard enough or something, and instead deleted an object from my library and GM auto saved with no "undo" option So I had to rebuild the entire object from scratch after figuring out which one it even was Why is it so easy to permanently delete an object from GM with zero failsafes or recovery options. I liked Vortex but messy data folder pissed me off when I had a heavily modded setup. I had a very long playthrough working through Vortex and then all of sudden I couldn't install mods anymore or switch profiles and my save pretty much broke. Made the switch to Mod Organizer 2 and nothing beats having a clean data folder. I also find installing mods and activating them to be super fast no more of the lag I was experiencing with Vortex. Also like that Mod Organizer 2 works great for classic. I'm sure this is already well known around here, but for anyone new to the Vita hacking scene since the trinity exploit (thank you devs!), I highly recommend using a micro sd card reader plugged into your PC. It took several hours for me to move over a few games over FTP, and it wasn't much better with directly plugged in via USB. By plugging in my sd card directly, I was able to move about 300gb of games in the same few hours it took to move two. WAY faster and way easier. I have what seems like a very simple question. I have two SMB shares. photos - which would be read only to everyone in the household inbox - which would be writeable by guest The idea is that family members can easily copy photos they wish to share and archive to inbox. Then a separate process will review the photos and move them to a final location based on date and other attributes in the image. One strategy is that I could run that process as root on the unraid server itself. I assume. I downloaded waterfox (linux), copied my profile and launched it but no addons at all. I was on firefox 62.0 (I probably still have my profile from befoe 57 though) and I would like to get some of the addons to work but they're all disabled. This is utterly confusing, there is no tutorial, nothing. I even wonder if waterfox only works with old addons or also with new addons from firefox? Also if I work my ass to reenable all my old addons from 2 years ago, will v68 make them all obsolete again. This has been going on for about 5 years, I think I've learned every possible way of preserving disk space, but here I am again, with just 2 MBs left. I install most programs in my 2 TB HDD, but some don't allow you to change install location and even the ones that do, usually take up space in the main drive by putting tons of trash in AppData and the likes. When I'm aware that the program I'm installing will not allow me to change directory and will take up a ton of space on my SSD, I usually. # BGC_Tools and CleanBGCProject I recently posted to share news about BGC_Tools (https://github.com/UCRBrainGameCenter/BGC_Tools), our internal utility repository for Unity projects, going public (https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bcaue6/large_unity_code_dump/). However, that post was perhaps a little premature and a little brief. In order to facilitate use I knew we really needed to accompany it with a demo project showing some of the features in in use. This post is to introduce. 
I want to play PS3 ISOs on the external HDD. Should I use mmCM to create them from PS3 backups on folder game (JB) format or should I create them using the PS3 Tools Collection's context menu item or PS3 ISO Tools (I think I should select the 4.76 FW on the latter) and afterwards send them to the external HDD's PS3ISO folder? If I use the second or the last will it take less time and later won't even work when trying to load the games on mmCM? I know this might be a stupid question but should. Photo Mechanic 6 has been released and is now available for purchase and download. I'm surprised this isn't bigger news, as it's essential software for many of us. Here is what's new (https://home.camerabits.com/whats-new-in-photo-mechanic-6/), and here is a link to the Camera Bits forum ( with more details on the release. I'm looking forward to hearing some reports on the new features over the coming. I've been using Linux for half a year so far. So far I've been using `tar` to backup my files, which takes, however rather long, resulting in probably monthly backups. After accidentally deleting my documents from the last three weeks (luckily there weren't many) I am searching for a faster solution, thus something like incremental backup. I do not want to reinstall my system, thus changing to btrfs snapshots or using lvm isn't an option. I tend to use rsync ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/inde. </p>
